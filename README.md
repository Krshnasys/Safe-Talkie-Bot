Since you're busy and want to tackle the MongoDB-based bad word list feature later, I’ll focus on creating a stylish and professional README for your Telegram bot repository at `https://github.com/Krshnasys/Safe-Talkie-Bot`. I’ll ensure the README is clear, visually appealing, and highlights the bot’s features, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines, tailored to your current bot’s functionality (group management, bad word/URL filtering, `/start`, `/id`, `/info` commands, admin exemptions). I’ll assume the bot’s name is **Safe Talkie Bot**, based on the repo name, and emphasize its role in maintaining safe group conversations.

Below is the README content, formatted for GitHub Markdown with a professional and modern style. I’ll avoid speculative features and stick to the bot’s current capabilities, ensuring it’s easy for users and contributors to understand.

**Safe Talkie Bot** is a powerful Telegram bot designed to create safe and moderated group conversations. With robust bad word and URL filtering, user information commands, and admin-friendly controls, it ensures your Telegram groups remain respectful and secure. Built with Python and Pyrogram, Safe Talkie Bot is lightweight, reliable, and easy to deploy.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Moderation**:
  - Filters and deletes messages containing bad words or URLs to maintain a respectful environment.
  - Sends standalone warnings to users without replying to their messages.
- **User Information Commands**:
  - `/start`: Initializes the bot, with admin-only access in private messages and restricted group access.
  - `/id`: Retrieves the user ID, chat ID, or channel ID (if forwarded).
  - `/info`: Displays detailed user information, including ID, username, and premium status.
- **Admin Privileges**:
  - Admins (configured in `config.json`) are exempt from filtering and have full access to bot commands.
  - Non-admins receive restricted responses in private messages and unauthorized groups.
- **Robust Deployment**:
  - Deployed on Heroku with a single-threaded architecture for stability.
  - MongoDB integration (planned) for scalable data management.
- **Logging & Metrics**:
  - Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
  - Tracks message counts, deletions, and errors for performance insights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy Safe Talkie Bot on your own server or Heroku.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Obtain from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- **Heroku Account**: For easy deployment (optional)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krshnasys/Safe-Talkie-Bot.git
   cd Safe-Talkie-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Bot**:
   - Create a `config.json` file based on `config.json.example`:
     ```json
     {
       "telegram_api_id": "your_api_id",
       "telegram_api_hash": "your_api_hash",
       "telegram_bot_token": "your_bot_token",
       "admins": [7533858093],
       "auth_groups": [-1002573318527],
       "use_auth": true,
       "delete_urls": true,
       "memory_threshold": 512
     }
     ```
   - Obtain `api_id` and `api_hash` from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - Update `bad_words.txt` with words to filter (one per line, e.g., `exchange`).

4. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   ```bash
   export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```

5. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   python base.py
   ```

### Deploy to Heroku

1. **Create a Heroku App**:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   heroku create safe-talkie-bot
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set CONFIG_FILE=config.json
   heroku config:set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   heroku ps:scale worker=1
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail`
   - Test the bot by sending `/start` in an authorized group or as an admin in PM.

## 📖 Usage

- **Commands**:
  - `/start`: Start the bot (admin-only in PM, restricted in unauthorized groups).
  - `/id`: Get your user ID, group ID, or channel ID (if replying to a forwarded message).
  - `/info`: View user details (ID, username, premium status, etc.).
- **Moderation**:
  - Messages with bad words or URLs are deleted in authorized groups.
  - Standalone warnings are sent to users (e.g., “Please avoid inappropriate words”).
- **Admin Access**:
  - Admins can send any message without filtering.
  - Non-admins receive `UNAUTHORIZED_GROUP_TXT` in PM or unauthorized groups.
